# Contributing guidelines

Please make sure that your pull request (PR) meets the following criteria:
- The PR has a clear title.
- The PR has a clear description.
- The PR is kept minimal; multiple features should ideally be addressed in multiple PRs.

Furthermore, don't feel restricted to contribute. Spelling mistakes or minor code suggestions are always welcome!
